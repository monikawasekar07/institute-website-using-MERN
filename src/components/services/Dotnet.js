        <h2>DOT NET (.NET)..!</h2>
        <p>
          The .NET framework is a pure object oriented, that similar to the Java language. But it is not a platform <br />
          independent as the Java. So, its application runs only to the windows platform.
          <br /><br />

          The main objective of this framework is to develop an application that can run on the windows platform.
          <br /><br />
          .NET is “an open source developer platform, created by Microsoft, for building many different types of applications.<br />
          You can write .NET apps in C#, F#, Visual C++, or Visual Basic.”<br /><br />

          Informally, .NET is the tool that lets you build and run C# programs (we’ll avoid F#, Visual C++, Visual Basic for now).
          <br /><br />
          There are a few versions of .NET. They do the same job but they are meant for different operating systems:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>.NET Framework is the original version of .NET that only runs on Windows computers.</li><br />
            <li>.NET Core is the new, cross-platform version of .NET that runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux computers.<br />
              Since it’s more flexible and Microsoft is actively enhancing this version, we’ll be using this one throughout<br />
              the path.</li>
          </ul>
        </p><br></br>

          <h4>Components Of .Net Framework </h4><br />
          <p>The .NET Framework is composed of four main components:</p>
          Common Language Runtime (CLR)<br />
          Framework Class Library (FCL),<br />
          Core Languages (WinForms, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET), and<br />
          Other Modules (WCF, WPF, WF, Card Space, LINQ, Entity Framework, Parallel LINQ, Task Parallel Library, etc.)<br />
        </p>

        <h2>CLR (Common Language Runtime)</h2><br />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          It is a program execution engine that loads and executes the program. It converts the program into native code. <br />
          It acts as an interface between the framework and operating system. It does exception handling, memory management,<br />
          and garbage collection. Moreover, it provides security, type-safety, interoperability, and portablility. A list of CLR <br />
          components are given below:

        </p><br />


        <h2>FCL (Framework Class Library)</h2>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          It is a standard library that is a collection of thousands of classes and used to build an application. The BCL (Base Class Library)<br />
          is the core of the FCL and provides basic functionalities.<br />
          <br />

        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Core Languages</h2>
        <br />
        <h4>WINFORMS</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Windows Forms is a smart client technology for the .NET Framework, a set of managed libraries that simplify common application tasks such <br />
          as reading and writing to the file system.
        </p>

        <h4>ASP.NET</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          ASP.NET is a web framework designed and developed by Microsoft. It is used to develop websites, web applications, and web services. It provides<br />
          a fantastic integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h4>ADO.NET</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          ADO.NET is a module of .Net Framework, which is used to establish a connection between application and data sources. Data sources can be such<br />as
          SQL Server and XML. ADO .NET consists of classes that can be used to connect, retrieve, insert, and delete data.
        </p>

        <h4>WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a graphical subsystem by Microsoft for rendering user <br />
          interfaces in Windows-based applications. WPF, previously known as "Avalon", was initially released as part of .NET Framework 3.0 in <br />
          2006. WPF uses DirectX.
        </p>

        <h4>WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service <br />
          endpoint to another.
        </p>

        <h4>WF (Workflow Foundation)</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) is a Microsoft technology that provides an API, an in-process workflow engine, and a rehostable<br />
          designer to implement long-running processes as workflows within .NET applications.
        </p>

        <h4>LINQ (Language Integrated Query)</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is a query language, introduced in .NET 3.5 framework. It is used to make the query for data sources with C# or Visual Basics <br />
          programming languages.
        </p>

        <h4>Entity Framework</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is an ORM based open source framework which is used to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates a lot of developers<br />
          effort to handle the database. It is Microsoft's recommended technology to deal with the database.
        </p>

        <h4>Parallel LINQ</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Parallel LINQ or PLINQ is a parallel implementation of LINQ to objects. It combines the simplicity and readability of LINQ and provides<br />
          the power of parallel programming.<br /><br />

          It can improve and provide fast speed to execute the LINQ query by using all available computer capabilities.<br />

          Apart from the above features and libraries, .NET includes other APIs and Model to improve and enhance the .NET framework.<br />
        </p>
