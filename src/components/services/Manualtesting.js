        <h2>MANUAL TESTING..!</h2>
        <p>
          Manual testing is a software testing process in which test cases are executed manually without using any automated tool.<br />
          All test cases executed by the tester manually according to the end user's perspective. It ensures whether the application<br />
          is working, as mentioned in the requirement document or not. Test cases are planned and implemented to complete almost  <br />
          100 percent of the software application. Test case reports are also generated manually.<br></br><br />

          Manual Testing is one of the most fundamental testing processes as it can find both visible and hidden defects of the software. <br />
          The difference between expected output and output,given by the software, is defined as a defect. The developer fixed the defects <br />
          and handed it to the tester for retesting.<br /><br />

          Manual testing is mandatory for every newly developed software before automated testing. This testing requires great efforts and<br />
          time, but it gives the surety of bug-free software.Manual Testing requires knowledge of manual testing techniques but not of any <br />
          automated testing tool.<br></br><br />

          Manual testing is essential because one of the software testing fundamentals is "100% automation is not possible."
        </p><br></br>


        <div>
          <h5>There are various methods used for manual testing. Each technique is used according to its testing criteria. <br></br>
            Types of manual testing are given below:</h5><br></br><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li><b>White Box Testing</b></li>
            <li><b>Black Box Testing</b></li>
            <li><b>Grey Box Testing</b></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />


        <p>White-box testing:<br />
          The white box testing is done by Developer, where they check every line of a code before giving it to the Test Engineer.<br />
          Since the code is visible for the Developer during the testing, that's why it is also known as White box testing.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Black-box testing:<br />
          The black box testing is done by the Test Engineer, where they can check the functionality of an application or the <br />
          software according to the customer /client's needs. In this, the code is not visible while performing the testing; <br />
          +that's why it is known as black-box testing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Grey-box testing:<br />
          Gray box testing is a combination of white box and Black box testing. It can be performed by a person who knew both<br />
          coding and testing. And if the single person performs white box, as well as black-box testing for the application,<br />
          is known as Gray box testing.

            1. Requirement Analysis: <br />
            Requirement Analysis is the first step of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC).<br />
            In this phase quality assurance team understands the requirements like what is to be tested.
            If anything is missing or not understandable then the quality assurance team meets with The
            stakeholders to better understand the detailed knowledge of requirements.<br /><br />

            2. Test Planning: Test Planning is the most efficient phase of the software testing<br />
            life cycle where all testing plans are defined. In this phase manager of the testing, <br />
            team calculates the estimated effort and cost for the testing work. This phase gets started <br />
            once the requirement-gathering phase is completed.<br /><br />

            3. Test Case Development: The test case development phase gets started once the test planning <br />
            phase is completed. In this phase testing team notes down the detailed test cases. The testing team <br />
            also prepares the required test data for the testing. When the test cases are prepared then they are<br />
            reviewed by the quality assurance team. <br></br> <br />


            4. Test Environment Setup: Test environment setup is a vital part of the STLC. Basically, the test<br />
            environment decides the conditions on which software is tested. This is independent activity and<br />
            can be started along with test case development. In this process, the testing team is not involved.<br />
            either the developer or the customer creates the testing environment.<br /><br />

            5. Test Execution: After the test case development and test environment setup test execution phase gets started.<br />
            In this phase testing team starts executing test cases based on prepared test cases in the earlier step.  <br /><br />

            6. Test Closure: Test closure is the final stage of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) where all testing-related<br />
            activities are completed and documented. The main objective of the test closure stage is to ensure that all testing-related<br />
            activities have been completed and that the software is ready for release.

          <h4>HOW TO START A PROJECT ON MANUAL TESTING:</h4><br />
          <p>
            Understand Project Requirements:<br />
            Gain a thorough understanding of the project requirements, specifications, and user expectations. This will help you identify critical<br />
            areas for testing.<br /><br />

            Define Test Objectives and Scope:<br />
            Clearly define the objectives of your testing efforts. Determine what aspects of the application you need to test and set the scope of<br />
            your testing activities. <br /><br />

            Create a Test Plan:<br />
            Develop a comprehensive test plan outlining the testing strategy, resources, schedule, and deliverables. This plan serves as a roadmap<br />
            for your testing activities.<br /><br />

            Identify Test Cases:<br />
            Based on the requirements, create detailed test cases covering various scenarios, including positive and negative cases. Ensure that your<br />
            test cases are well-documented and easily understandable.<br /><br />

            Set Up Test Environment:<br />
            Establish a testing environment that mimics the production environment as closely as possible. Ensure that all necessary hardware, software,<br />
            and configurations are in place.<br /><br />

            Execute Test Cases:<br />
            Perform manual testing by executing the test cases. Document the results, including any defects or issues identified during the testing process.<br /><br />

            Defect Reporting:<br />
            If you find defects or issues during testing, report them to the development team using a standardized defect reporting format. Include detailed<br />
            information about the issue, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs.<br /><br />

            Regression Testing:<br />
            Conduct regression testing to ensure that new changes or fixes do not negatively impact existing functionalities. This helps maintain the overall<br />
            integrity of the application.<br /><br />

            Collaborate with Stakeholders:<br />
            Communicate regularly with stakeholders, including developers, product managers, and business analysts. Keep them informed about the <br />testing progress,
            issues, and any potential risks.<br /><br />

            Document Test Results:<br />
            Document your testing results, including test execution status, defects found, and any other relevant information. This documentation is valuable <br />
            for future
            reference and reporting.<br /><br />

            Review and Improve:<br />
            Conduct regular reviews of your testing process and identify areas for improvement. This could include refining test cases, optimizing the testing<br /> environment,
            or enhancing communication with the development team.<br /><br />

            Closure and Reporting:<br />
            When testing is complete, provide a summary report that outlines the testing activities, results, and any outstanding issues. This report helps <br />stakeholders make
            informed decisions about the project's readiness for release.
