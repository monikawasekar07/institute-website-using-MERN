        <h2>DEVOPS..!</h2>
        <p>
          DevOps refers to a set of cultural concepts, practices, and technologies that improves an organization’s<br />
          capacity to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster<br />
          pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management methods.<br /><br />

          This agileness enables organizations to better serve their clients and compete more effectively in the market.<br />

          Although DevOps is a relatively new job profile,it will be a good step up the career ladder if you are already working <br />
          in Cloud Computing as an Architect or Developer.<br /><br />

          For the next several years, DevOps will be a high-impact, demanding, and vital role. If this trend and job path excite you,<br />
          it’s the best opportunity to explore DevOps.

          <h4>How does DevOps work?</h4>
          <p>
            A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle,<br>
            </br> in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. It’s a new way of working, a cultural <br />
            shift, that has significant implications for teams and the organizations they work for.<br /><br />

            Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams merge into a<br />

            single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle — from development and test to deployment and<br />
            operations — and have a range of multidisciplinary skills.<br /><br />

            DevOps teams use tools to automate and accelerate processes, which helps to increase reliability. A DevOps toolchain helps teams tackle <br />
            important DevOps fundamentals including continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration.<br /><br />

            DevOps values are sometimes applied to teams other than development. When security teams adopt a DevOps approach, security is an active and <br />
            integrated part of the development process. This is called DevSecOps.<br />

          <p>
            DevOps is the next evolution of agile methodologies. A cultural shift that brings development and operations teams together. DevOps is <br />
            a practice that involves a cultural change, new management principles, and technology tools that help to implement best practices.<br /><br />

            When it comes to a DevOps toolchain, organizations should look for tools that improve collaboration, reduce context-switching, introduce automation,<br />
            and leverage observability and monitoring to ship better software, faster. <br />

            <br />
            Regardless of the type of DevOps toolchain an organization uses, a DevOps process needs to use the right tools to  address the key phases of the DevOps lifecycle:<br /><br />
