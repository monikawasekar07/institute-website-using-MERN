          <h4>Frond End Deveopment</h4>
          <p>
            Front end development focuses on the user-interactive visual elements of a website or app (the client side) through HTML, CSS & Javascript.</p>
          <br></br>

          <h4>Controller (middle layer between Front end and Back End):</h4>

          <p>User interact with application with the help of frontend and try to GET or POST data in backend database so we need a connector between<br></br>
            frontend and backend and that is why we need Django or Angular or React or Java as controller.</p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>Back End Development</h4>

          <p>Back-end development focuses on the side of a website users can‚Äôt see (the server side).</p>
          <br></br>

          <h4>Database</h4>

          <p>Database is the collection of interrelated data that helps in efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes<br></br>
            the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc.</p>
          <br></br>

          <h4>Web Application Architecture</h4>

          <p>Web Application Architecture is a framework consisting of the relationships and interactions between application middleware, UI‚Äôs, and databases.</p>
          <br></br>

          <h4>Git Version Control System</h4>

          <p>Git is VCS (Version Control System), a free and open-source tool. It makes it easy for you to track, manage and share changes in your source code<br></br>
            files over time. With Git, you can handle small to very large projects quickly and efficiently.</p>
