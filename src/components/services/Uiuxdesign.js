        <h2>UI/UX DESIGN..!</h2>
        <p>
          User interface design is also known as user interface engineering. User interface design means the process of designing user<br />
          interfaces for software and machines like a mobile device, home appliances, computer, and another electronic device with the <br />
          aim of increasing usability and improving the user experience.
          <br /><br />

          The aim of user interface design is to make user experiences as easy as possible while still being successful in achieving user <br />
          goals (user-centered design).
          <br /><br />

          A well-designed user interface design makes it easier to complete the task in hand without drawing needless attention to itself. <br />
          Graphic design and typography are used to influence its utility by influencing how the consumer interacts with it and improving the<br />
          design's aesthetic appeal. Design aesthetics can increase or decrease the user's ability to use interface's functions. <br />
          The design process should balance technical functionality as well as visual elements (for example, mental model) in order<br />
          to build a system that is not only operational but as well usable and adaptable to evolving user requirements.
          <br /><br />

          Interface design is used in various projects, including computer systems, commercial planes, automobiles; many of these projects<br />
          include many of the same basic human interactions, but they often include certain special skills and experience. Consequently, <br />
          whether it is software design, industrial design, user research or web design, designers prefer to specialize in those types of <br />
          projects and have skills- based around their experience.

          <h4>Designing User Interfaces for Users</h4><br />
          <p>
            <h4>Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)</h4>
            <p>In the Graphical user interface, the users can interact with visual representations on the digital control panels. Example of <br />
              GUI, a computer's desktop.</p>
          </p>
          <h4>Gesture-Based Interfaces</h4>
          <p>
            In gesture-based interfaces, users can interact with 3D design spaces by moving their bodies. Example of Gesture-Based Interfaces,<br />
            Virtual Reality (VR) games.
          </p>
          <h4>Voice-Controlled Interfaces (VUIs)</h4>
          <p>
            In, Voice-controlled interfaces (VUIs), users can interact with the help of the voice. Example of Voice-Controlled Interfaces (VUIs),<br />
            Alexa on Amazon devices, and Siri on iPhone.

        <h2>User Interface Design Requirements</h2><br />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          The dynamic characteristics of a system are defined in terms of the dialogue requirements contained in 7 principles of part 10 <br />
          of the ergonomics standard, the ISO 9241. This standard provides a system of ergonomic "principles" for the dialogue techniques <br />
          along with the high-level concepts, examples, and implementations. The principles of the dialogue reflect the interface's dynamic <br />
          aspects and mostly thought of as the interface's "feel." The following are the seven dialogue principles:
          <br />
          <br /><br />
          <img src='https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/user-interface-design3.png' />
        </p><br />
        <h5 style={{ marginLeft: '90px' }}><FaArrowRight />Suitability of the Task:</h5>
        <p>
          The dialogue is appropriate for the task when it helps the user in completing the task efficiently and effectively.
        </p>

        <h5 style={{ marginLeft: '90px' }}><FaArrowRight />Self-Descriptiveness:</h5>
        <p>When each dialogue phase is instantly understandable due to system feedback or clarified to the user upon request,<br />
          the dialogue is self-descriptive.</p>

        <h5 style={{ marginLeft: '90px' }}> <FaArrowRight />Controllability:</h5>
        <p>
          When the user is capable to initiate and monitor the course and speed of the interaction until the aim is achieved,<br />
          then dialogue is controllable.
        </p>

        <h5 style={{ marginLeft: '90px' }}><FaArrowRight />Conformity with User Expectations: </h5>
        <p>
          If the dialogue is reliable and corresponds to the characteristics of the user, like experience, education, task <br />
          awareness, and generally accepted conventions, it conforms to user experience.
        </p>

        <h5 style={{ marginLeft: '90px' }}><FaArrowRight />Error Tolerance:</h5>
        <p>
          If, despite obvious errors in input, the desired outcome can be accomplished with no or limited action from the user,<br />
          then the dialogue is error-tolerant.
        </p>

        <h5 style={{ marginLeft: '90px' }}><FaArrowRight />Suitability for Individualization:</h5>
        <p>
          If the interface software can be changed to meet the job needs, individual interests, and abilities of the user, the<br />
          dialogue is able of individualization.
        </p>

        <h5 style={{ marginLeft: '90px' }}><FaArrowRight />Suitability for Leaning</h5>
        <p>
          The ISO 9241 standard defines usability as the effective performance and the satisfaction of the consumer.

        <h2>How to Make Great UIs</h2><br />

        <p><FaArrowRight />Create buttons, and other popular components that behave predictably (with responses like pinch-to-zoom)<br /><br />
          <FaArrowRight /> so that users can use them without thinking. Form must follow function.<br /><br></br>
          <FaArrowRight />Keep your discoverability high. Mark icons clearly and well-defined affordances, such as shadows for buttons.<br /><br />
          <FaArrowRight /> The interface should be simple (including elements that help users achieve their goals) and create an "invisible" feel.<br /><br />
          <FaArrowRight /> In terms of layout, respect the user's eyes and attention. Place emphasis on hierarchy and readability:<br /><br />

          <FaArrowRight />  User proper alignment: Usually select edge (over center) alignment.<br />
