        <h2>APP DEVELOPMENT..!</h2>
        <p>
          The App development courses with placement assistance offered by IT-services are designed by working professionals.<br></br>
          These app developer courses  provide the industry based skills to Students which they need to create app applications. <br></br>
          Students who complete these programs will be able to establish.<br></br><br />

          App development courses typically entail learning Java programming, Python, or other object-oriented programming <br />
          languages in a development environment. which is a workspace where programmers can write and make changes to code <br />
          without permanently altering the finished app.<br /><br />

          Students also learn how to develop programs with cross-platformfunctionality, meaning the app is developed to run on<br />
          multiple mobile operating systems simultaneously rather than requiring a separate version of the app for each operating system.<br />
          App development courses can also cover user experience, which focuses on designing and improving upon what it’s like to interact<br />
          with apps; software testing, which helps ensure apps do what they’re supposed to do; and more.

          <h2>Skills Required to Develop Android Apps..!</h2><br></br><br></br>
          <h4>1. An Unprecedented Knowledge of Java and Kotlin</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most must-have skills of all, proficiency in Java and Kotlin can be a game-changer for Android developers.<br />
            Used to develop native Android apps,both Java and Kotlin are programming languages that Android developers should be <br />
            comfortable working with.<br />

            In fact, in the case of Kotlin, Google has announced this statically typed programming language as the first choice for
            Android development.<br />
            As for Java, it is often used in an integrated development environment for Android application development.
            <br />
          </p>
          <br></br>

          <h4>2. Need to be Technically Sound</h4>

          <p>The Android app industry today is rapidly transforming and new trends continue to come up. In this era,it is vital< br />
            for developers to be technically sound and to be able to create innovative apps for virtually every device.<br /><br />

            Besides, with technological advancements happening with rapidity, integration of technologies like Artificial Intelligence,<br />
            Blockchain and 5G have revolutionized the way we thought of mobile apps years back. Today, while Blockchain provides security<br />
            against cyber threats, Artificial Intelligence is paving the way for more smart and innovative applications.

            It is perhaps safe to say that not just a hands-on experience of Android Studio, Android SDK, and APIs,<br /><br />
            but to stay updated with these latest technologies and things happening around them too is what matters.<br />

            Technical knowledge also becomes a vital factor because the success of any Android app depends on the kind of<br />
            expertise that goes into the creation of such an app. Hence, staying updated with the rapidly altering trends<br />
            and having a sound technical knowledge is the key today for Android app development.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4>3. Vital Sense of the UX/UI</h4>

          <p>Today, the majority of app users demand a highly engaging and responsive application that is easy to use.<br />
            Hence, the demand for an intuitive UX and UI rises even more.As per a report, more than half of the world app<br />
            users judge the app on the very first impression.
            <br></br><br />

            While this is a fact, the market too demands designers and developers with a sound understanding of the design of an app today. <br />
            So to develop an Android app that stands out, one needs to have a good knowledge of the design requirements of Android apps and<br />
            what type of designs users prefer.</p><br />

          <h4>4. The Significance of Critical Thinking.</h4>

          <p>Critical thinking is a crucial aspect of app development, and Android developers are not away from it.<br />
            For any developer longing to develop an Android app today,having a critical mindset is the key. <br />
            It allows developers to maneuver every move and test all possible points with as much clarity. <br />
            This is always beneficial as it reduces any potential chance of mistakes in coding an app.</p>

          interactive training with 30 hrs of assignments and 20 hrs of real-time ios projects with source code.<br />
          An iOS developer is someone with an in-depth understanding of the iOS ecosystem, including a deep understanding<br />
          of how it works on different Apple devices such as the iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. In short, they must<br />
          understand how to build and customize apps in the iOS ecosystem.<br />

          If you do a little bit of research, you’ll come across an iOS skills matrix, like the one shown below. This particular<br />
          iOS skills matrix is a compilation of the skills one should have at different levels on the way to becoming a senior iOS<br />
          developer. The matrix is precise enough to give you an idea of the iOS developer skills you need to have but, at the same<br />
          time, vague enough to avoid canonizing any one area of knowledge. In other words, it is meant tobe used merely as a guide<br />

        <h2>How TO START IOS PROJECT</h2><br />

        <h4>iOS Development:</h4><br />
        <p>iOS is Apple’s mobile OS that runs on an iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch hardware. Apple provides tools and resources for creating<br />
          iOS apps and accessories for these devices. As an iOS developer, you can program in native languages such as Swift or Objective-C <br />or build cross-platform native applications using React Native (JavaScript) or Xamarin (C# & F#).<br />
        </p><br />

        <h4>Developer Requirements:</h4><br />
        <p>To develop iOS apps, you need a Mac computer running the latest version of Xcode. Xcode is Apple’s IDE
          (Integrated Development Environment)<br />for both Mac and iOS apps. Xcode is the graphical interface you'll use to
          write iOS apps. Xcode includes the iOS SDK, tools, compilers, <br />
          and frameworks you need specifically to design,
          develop, write code,and debug an app for iOS. For native mobile app development <br />
          on iOS, Apple suggests<br />
          using the modern Swift programming language.<br />

          It is important to note that Xcode only runs on Mac OS X and the only supported way to develop iOS apps.<br /><br /></p>

        <h4>iOS Software Development Kit (SDK):</h4><br />
        <p>
          Explore the tools, technologies, capabilities, and languages included in the iOS SDK that make app development possible.<br />
          Some iOS SDK essentials are the Cocoa Touch frameworks that include the UIKit, GameKit, PushKit, Foundation Kit, and MapKit.<br></br>
          These frameworks and others allow you manipulate the iPhone or iPad camera, add voice interaction using SiriKit, explore music <br />
          with MusicKit, expand viewing and listening via AirPlay 2, and even add iMessage Business Chat to your application. iOS 11 added<br />
          the power of machine learning with Core ML and augmented reality (AR) experiences with ARKit.</p><br /><br />

        <h4>Prepare your development environment:</h4><br />
        <p>Download Xcode
          Launch Xcode and create a New Project
          Get familiar with Xcode
          Build and run your app using the built-in <br />
          iOS Simulator app that’s included in Xcode. <br />
          The iOS Simulator is a great way to see what your app will look like and you can interact
          with it as if you were on a real device.<br />
          You can simulate your app on a variety of hardware
          types and iOS versions.<br></br><br /></p>

        <h4>Beta Testing:</h4><br />
        <p>
          Once you have built and tested (using XCTest framework or iOS Unit test) your app, you can invite users to your apps and <br />
          collect feedback using TestFlight prior to deploying to the App Store. This is a good time for testing Push Notifications,<br />
          data storage using Core Data, and making network calls to 3rd party APIs. To get going, you simply upload a beta build of your app,<br />
          and use iTunes Connect to add the name and email of testers. The testers will install the TestFlight app for iOS so they can interact <br />
          with your app and provide valuable feedback.</p><br /><br />

        <h4>Cloud Testing</h4><br />
        <p>Testing your iOS app on real devices is critically important since the performance of the real device, different operating system versions,<br />
          modifications made by manufacturer and carriers firmware may lead to unexpected issues with your app. Testing on real device gives you a more<br />
          accurate understanding of how your users interact with your app.</p><br />

        <p>On the other hand, obtaining physical devices for testing is a logistical challenge. This is where cloud testing comes into play.<br />
          With cloud testing, you can test your application on real devices that are accessible on the cloud. You can perform a manual test or<br />
          run automated tests to ensure the quality of your application.</p><br />
        <h4>Deployment:</h4><br />
        <p>
          Once you have built, tested, and beta tested your iOS app, you can deploy to the App Store. At this point, you must join the Apple Developer Program. As a member, you’ll get access to beta software, advanced app capabilities, extensive beta testing tools, and app analytics.
