        <h2>BIG DATA..!</h2>
        <p>
          Big data refers to the large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates. It encompasses the <br />
          volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the <br />
          data points being covered (known as the "three v's" of big data). Big data often comes from data mining and arrives <br />
          in multiple formats.<br /><br />
          Big data can be categorized as unstructured or structured. Structured data consists of information already managed by<br />
          the organization in databases and spreadsheets; it is frequently numeric in nature. Unstructured data is information that<br />
          is unorganized and does not fall into a predetermined model or format. It includes data gathered from social media sources,<br />
          which help institutions gather information on customer needs.<br /><br />

          Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal<br />
          electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins. The presence of sensors and other<br />
          inputs in smart devices allows for data to be gathered across a broad spectrum of situations and circumstances.<br /><br />
          <br></br><br />

          <h3>KEY TAKEWAYS</h3><br />
          <li>  Big data is a great quantity of diverse information that arrives in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity.</li><br /><br />
          <li>Big data can be structured (often numeric, easily formatted and stored) or unstructured (more free-form, less quantifiable).</li><br />
          <li>Nearly every department in a company can utilize findings from big data analysis, but handling its clutter and noise can pose<br />
            problems.</li><br />
          <li>Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal<br />
            electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins. </li><br />
          <li>Big data is most often stored in computer databases and is
            analyzed using software specifically designed to handle large, <br />complex data sets.</li>

          Companies use big data in their systems to improve operations, provide better customer service,<br />
          create personalized marketing campaigns and take other actions that, ultimately, can increase revenue
          and profits. Businesses that use it effectively hold a potential competitive advantage over those that don't
          because they're able to make faster and more informed business decisions.  <br /><br />

          For example, big data provides valuable insights into customers that companies can use to refine their marketing,
          advertising and promotions in order to increase customer engagement and conversion rates. Both historical and real-time
          data can be analyzed to assess the evolving preferences of consumers or corporate buyers, enabling businesses to become more
          responsive to customer wants and needs.<br /><br />

          Here are some more examples of how big data is used by organizations:<br /><br />
          <li> In the energy industry, big data helps oil and gas companies identify potential drilling locations and monitor pipeline operations; likewise, utilities use it to track electrical grids.</li>
          <li> Financial services firms use big data systems for risk management and real-time analysis of market data.</li>
          <li> Manufacturers and transportation companies rely on big data to manage their supply chains and optimize delivery routes.</li>
          <li> Other government uses include emergency response, crime prevention and smart city initiatives.</li>

        <h2>Big Data Management Technologies</h2><br />
        <p>
          Hadoop, an open source distributed processing framework released in 2006, initially was at the center of most big data architectures.<br />
          The development of Spark and other processing engines pushed MapReduce, the engine built into Hadoop, more to the side. The result is <br />
          an ecosystem of big data technologies that can be used for different applications but often are deployed together.
          <br />
        </p><br />

        <p>
          Big data platforms and managed services offered by IT vendors combine many of those technologies in a single package, primarily for use <br />
          in the cloud. Currently, that includes these offerings, listed alphabetically:<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li> Amazon EMR (formerly Elastic MapReduce)</li>
            <li> Cloudera Data Platform</li>
            <li>  Google Cloud Dataproc</li>
            <li> HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric (formerly MapR Data Platform)</li>
            <li>  Microsoft Azure HDInsight</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          For organizations that want to deploy big data systems themselves, either on premises or in the cloud,the technologies<br />
          that are available to them in addition to Hadoop and Spark include the following categories of tools:
        </p><br />

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              storage repositories, such as the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and cloud <br />
              object storage services that include Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Google Cloud<br />
              Storage and Azure Blob Storage;
            </li>
            <li>
              cluster management frameworks, like Kubernetes, Mesos and YARN, Hadoop's built-in resource<br />
              manager and job scheduler, which stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator but is commonly<br />
              known by the acronym alone;
            </li>
            <li>
              stream processing engines, such as Flink, Hudi, Kafka, Samza, Storm and the Spark Streaming and<br />
              Structured Streaming modules built into Spark;
            </li>
            <li>
              NoSQL databases that include Cassandra, Couchbase, CouchDB, HBase, MarkLogic Data Hub, MongoDB,<br />
              Neo4j, Redis and various other technologies;
            </li>
            <li>
              data lake and data warehouse platforms, among them Amazon Redshift, Delta Lake, Google BigQuery,<br />
              Kylin and Snowflake; and
