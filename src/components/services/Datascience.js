        <h2>DATA SCIENCE..!</h2>
        <p>
          Join the best Data Science courses in Pune, covering all aspects of the data science project life cycle, starting with data collection,<br />
          data cleaning, data exploration, data modelling, and culminating with the interpretation of data.<br /><br />

          Our Data Science certification classes provide students with one of the best hands-on exposures to essential technologies to master data science,<br />
          machine learning, and data analytics and visualisation.<br /><br />

          With hands-on projects based on Python and its libraries, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing<br />
          through live interaction with the instructor, learners will have a great opportunity to become Data Science Professionals.<br /><br />


          Data is everywhere and is one of the most important features of every organization that helps a business to flourish by making decisions based on facts,<br />
          statistical numbers, and trends. Due to this growing scope of data, data science came into the picture which is a multidisciplinary IT field, and data scientists’<br />
          jobs are the most demanding in the 21st century.<br /><br />


          Data has become the most valuable asset in the world right now, this has also raised the need for skilled data scientists for the job. Currently,<br />
          there is a shortage of Data scientists in the world – According to a recent report by the Information Systems Employment Consortium (ISEC), there will <br />
          be a shortage of over 2 million data scientists by 2026.<br /><br />

          To succeed in data science, you need both technical and non-technical skills. It’s important to understand the key technical concepts, but you should also <br />
          know some soft skills like communication and leadership.
